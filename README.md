## General info
This project contains a tic tac toe game with various gameplay options. First, the player can choose to play against the computer, which itself has two difficulty levels: easy and impossible. The easy mode just fills up the first spot available going from left to right and from top to bottom. The impossible mode uses a minimax algorithm, in which the computer assesses each possible move and assigns it a score. From that score, the computer picks the best possible move, which results in the computer being unbeatable. The user can also pick a multiplayer mode, which allows two players to play against each other.
